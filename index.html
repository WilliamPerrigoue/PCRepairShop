            While the <span class="repair-shop">Green River College PC Repair Shop</span> is a student-run
            operation. It is important to note that the shop may not have the capacity to handle every request. For all
            broken parts and surrendered computers,
            we dispose of responsibly through an E-cycling center. These centers will accept any and all electronic
            devices/accessories and dispose of them accordingly.
            These centers are in partnership with the state of Washington and offer this service to educational
            institutions at no cost to the school.
            For more information about E-cycling, please visit the official Washington state <a

                style="color:lightcoral;">E-cycle Washington</a> website.
            This recycling service is also free of charge to the public, so if you have any old electronics that you
            want to recycle, pay one of the E-cycling sites a visit!<br><br>
