    <p>Do you have all the parts to your ideal gaming computer, but haven't had the time or the ability to put everything together? Bring it to us, we will make the magic happen. 
        Our builds don't miss, we hit 360 no-scopes around here, and you move up the leaderboards. Don't believe it? Bring it in. I'm telling you, we make it happen.<br>
    <br>The main issue that we run into when building computers is that our customers either don't have all the parts, or they have parts that are not compatible with each other.
    If you are unsure about the compatibility of your parts, we can help you with that. We use <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/" style="color:lightcoral;">PCPartPicker</a> to check compatibility and to help you find the best parts for your build.
    If you would like to find the parts yourself, but want to make sure you're putting together a compatible build, we recommend using PCPartPicker as well. We are still here to help and can verify a compatible build before you purchase any parts that may not work together.
    In addition to full builds, we can also upgrade parts in your existing build if you would like to replace or upgrade specific parts. For example, you may want to upgrade from 16GB of RAM to 32GB of RAM. We can get that done for you.

    <br><br>We can be contacted via email at <a href="mailto:pcrepairshop@greenriver.edu"
